# EduRemit AI – Secure Education Funding on Stellar

EduRemit AI is a decentralized, transparent, and low-cost education remittance application built on the Stellar network. It empowers parents to send education funds securely, students to track their spending with AI-powered budgeting, and universities to receive tuition directly on-chain without high intermediary fees.

## Deployed Smart Contract Address (Testnet)
- **Network**: Stellar Testnet
- **Token**: Native XLM Stellar Asset
- *(Note: Transactions are executed as native Horizon API asset transfers via Freighter, eliminating the need for a custom Soroban contract for standard remittances).*
